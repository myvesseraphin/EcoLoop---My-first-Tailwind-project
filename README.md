# EcoLoop - Turn Waste into Worth

EcoLoop is Rwanda's first student-built "Phygital" circular-economy ecosystem.  
It combines AI software and embedded hardware to identify e-waste, detect hazards, and recover valuable materials.

## Project Description

Rwanda's digital growth is increasing e-waste volumes while critical metals are still imported for renewable infrastructure.  
EcoLoop addresses this gap by helping users quickly classify waste as valuable, reusable, or hazardous.

Core capabilities:
- AI component recognition for e-waste parts.
- Hazard alerts for toxic or dangerous materials.
- Guided safe-disassembly support.
- Smart valuation and recycling decision support.
- Hardware-assisted safety and verification through sensor-enabled tools.

The goal is to protect health, reduce pollution risks, and turn waste into economic opportunity through circular resource recovery.

## React Version

This repository has been migrated to React + Vite while preserving the original UI layout.

Added in the React migration:
- Base44 app links removed/replaced with internal navigation.
- Particle animation background layer.
- EcoLoop branded loader with animated surrounding circles.
- Improved hero image alignment.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
